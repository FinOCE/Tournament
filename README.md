# Tournament Generator

A project that can be used to create and host a variety of tournaments. Built in C#, the API will be publicly accessible so that tournament experiences can be easily built on any site without needing to redirect to a different platform. As well as this, a first-party site will also be created that works similar to current solutions kept up-to-date with API features.

I started this project because I wanted originally wanted to create something similar as a part of a different site, but realised the project was far bigger than expected. Instead, I chose to make it as a separate service, and since it would be completely detached from the original project, there would be no reason to not make it publicly accessible for other developers to use as well. While the API is still in development, it will eventually support a variety of tournament formats with extensive team management. Once the API itself is completed, work will begin on the first-party site, which will also be included as a part of this solution. As well as this, I would like to develop an API wrapper in Typescript so that it can be easily used in JS/TS projects, like my original project.
